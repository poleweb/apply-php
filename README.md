# Dig into PHP

## Exercise
For the next questions write all your answers in the file `answers.php`

Note that there will not be any "compilation" so it's not worth to make it work. A text file would be fine ! 

**Reminder : make as much commits as possible means one foreach answer, it's important.**

### Display
Try to echo these following cases :

* A string (whatever you want)
* A string with numbers
* A string with special characters
* Conditionally change the string with a true/false condition
* A concatenation of theses 3 different strings

### Loops
* Display all numbers between 1 and 10 (including 10) using a `while` loop
* Same as before but with a `for` loop
* Wrap the while loop inside a function and call it
* Write a function that take a parameter `$max` and display all values from 1 to `$max` using a `while` loop. Call it with a value of 20

### Arrays
Given this array `array(5, 12, 10, 21, 2, 6, 8, 20, 14, 9, 12)`

Write & wrap your code inside functions for the following cases :

* Display all the elements of the array
* Find the average value
* Find out how many values are equal or greater than 10
* Check if the value 20 is present in the array
* Get the greatest value of the array
